# Knight's Travails

In this project we will create a class that will find the shortest path for a Chess Knight from a starting position to an end position. Both the start and end positions should be on a standard eight-by-eight chess board

At the end of this project, you should be able to bring together lots that you've learned, this week, as well as bringing back information you learned earlier in the course, such as:

* declaring classes in Python

* creating and using lists in Python

* using list comprehensions in Python

* using loops in Python

* using conditionals in Python

* using the tree data structure

* using tree searches to find nodes

You'll also use unit tests fro part of it to guide your development like you did in Node.js-land

## Getting started

Make sure that you're running a 3.8 version of Python by typing `python --version` in your terminal

Clone the starter project:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/python-knights-travail
```

Change directory into the cloned repository

Run the tests w/ the following command line. Note that you'll need to create a `tree.py` file before being able to view the test errors. Run the following command from the root directory of the project, not from within the `test` directory:

```zsh
python -m unittest
```

At the top of your test response, you'll see "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE". This indicates that you have seventeen test errors. As you write code and pass tests, you'll see each `E` change to a `.` for a passed test or an `F` for a failed test. At the bottom, you can also see how many failed tests you have "FAILED (errors=17)"
